## Quick Start

As long as your environment meets the following dependencies, 
you should be able to run it by having a terminal open in the 
intended directory and running:

> $ python3 KNN.py

A line chart will generate after all accuracies have been computed.

### Dependencies:

Python >= 3.8  
Pandas >= 1.4.4  
MatPlotLib >= 3.5.3

## Which k-Value Works the Best?

After repeated runs of the program, it would seem no 
K-value in this set (1-20) is any "better" than other K-values in
the set overall. One K-value that exceeds expectations in one 
round may be average--or worse--in the following rounds. I expect 
this is due to both the similarity in plant species and the relatively
small size of the data set.
